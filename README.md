# Pomodoro-App
Pomodoro App that enables you to write work sessions' goals

This pomodoro app consists of 3 cycles of 25 min of work and a 5 min short break, followed by 1 cycle of 25 min of work and a 20 min long break.
The timer will automatically stop at this point. You can manually reset it at any time as well.

When you start the timer you will be prompted to type your goal for the next work session, and uppon hitting 'Enter' you will see it displayed on the screen.
This goal can be edited before starting the timer or during any work session, but not during a break.

A green checkmark will appear on the screen after each work session ends.

This project was built using Python's built-in GUI module tkinter, and was inspired by Dr. Anyela Yu's Udemy course '100 Days of Code'.
